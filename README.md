# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Database Migrations

### UUID Migration (June 2024)

The application has been updated to use UUIDs for preparation IDs and related foreign keys. This ensures compatibility with Supabase's UUID column types.

Key changes:
- Preparation IDs are now UUIDs instead of descriptive strings
- The original exam ID is stored in a metadata field for debugging
- Migration scripts in `supabase/migrations` handle converting existing data

If you encounter any issues with preparation loading after this update, check the following:
1. Ensure the Supabase migrations have been run
2. Clear local storage if testing locally
3. Check browser console for UUID-related errors

#### Troubleshooting Migration Errors

If you encounter this error during migration:
```
ERROR: 42883: operator does not exist: uuid ~ unknown
HINT: No operator matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add explicit type casts.
```

The issue is that PostgreSQL doesn't allow using regex operators with UUID types directly. The fix:
1. Make sure to cast the columns to text before applying regex: `id::text ~ pattern`
2. The migration files have been updated to add these casts
3. If you still encounter issues, you can manually run these SQL commands with the proper casts
