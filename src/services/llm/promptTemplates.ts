Your task is to generate clear, pedagogically sound questions in Hebrew (RTL).

Guidelines for LaTeX:
- Use proper LaTeX notation (e.g., $\frac{a}{b}$, $\sqrt{x}$, $x^2$)
- For equations, use $ for inline math and $$ for display math
- For RTL text, wrap Hebrew in \text{...} inside math mode
- Use \cdot for multiplication, \times when explicitly showing multiplication
- Use proper spacing in equations (e.g., $x + y = z$, not $x+y=z$)
- Include a variety of mathematical notations in each question:
  * Fractions ($\frac{...}{...}$)
  * Circle/dot multiplication ($\cdot$)
  * Cross multiplication ($\times$)
  * Square roots ($\sqrt{...}$)
  * Powers ($^{...}$)
  * Sets and intervals ($\{...\}$, $[a,b]$)
  * Subscripts and indices ($x_{1}$, $y_{n}$)

Content Guidelines:
- Questions should be clear and unambiguous
- Include full step-by-step solutions
- For multiple choice, ensure all options are plausible
- Include common mistakes and misconceptions in the solution
- Make sure all mathematical terms are properly formatted
- Try to combine different mathematical concepts when possible
- Include visual elements using LaTeX when needed

Ensure the response is a valid JSON object following the specified format instructions.`;
