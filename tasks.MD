Add tooltips on hover for each progress indicator showing question topic/result
Make the timer more prominent with a visual indicator (like color changes as time progresses)
Medium Effort:
Add a collapsible summary showing topics covered/remaining
Include a visual breakdown of performance by topic
B. Enhanced Bar (Filters/Metadata):
1. Quick Wins:
Group related filters under dropdown categories to reduce visual clutter
Add visual icons for different filter types
Use chips/tags for active filters with easy removal
Add a "Clear All" button for filters

C. Overall Design/Layout Improvements:
Quick Wins:
Increase contrast for important elements (the current design feels a bit flat)
Add subtle shadows to create visual hierarchy
Use consistent corner radius across all components
Implement a more distinct color scheme for different question states
Medium Effort:
Create a cohesive color palette that matches your brand
Add smooth transitions between states
Implement responsive layouts for different screen sizes
D. Feedback Improvements:
Quick Wins:
Add color-coded visual indicators for correct/incorrect answers
Include encouraging messages based on performance
Show immediate visual feedback when selecting an answer
Add progress indicators during answer checking
Medium Effort:
Implement a scoring animation
Add detailed explanation panels that can be expanded
Include related topic suggestions based on performance
Let me propose specific improvements for the highest impact/lowest effort item

E. Subject Service Integration:
Quick Wins:
- Replace direct topic ID display with getTopicName() in QuestionMetadata
- Update QuestionInteractionContainer to use subjectService instead of examService
- Add proper error handling for missing topics/subjects
- Add logging for subject/topic access patterns

Medium Effort:
- Create JSON schema for subject/topic data validation
- Add unit tests for SubjectService methods

F. Core Service Refactoring:
Long Term:
- Consolidate subject/topic management into SubjectService
  - Make SubjectService the single source of truth for subject/topic data
  - Update ExamService to use SubjectService as a utility
  - Remove duplicate topic/subject handling from ExamService
  - Update all service consumers to use the correct service
